# Secure_Query_Retrieval
Simple Credential-based routing mechanism, retrieval by query  

Project to build a knowledge management system that provides secure, credential-based access to information across multiple databases. Using LangChain, RAG, and LLMs, it allows for efficient retrieval of role-specific information while ensuring data privacy.

Features

Credential-Based Routing: Controls access to databases based on user roles.
Multi-Database Querying: Enables searches across different departments (e.g., Finance, HR, Technical).
RAG-Enhanced Retrieval: Uses embeddings and RAG for relevant document retrieval.
LLM-Driven Summarization: Generates role-specific insights based on access level.
Efficient Query Processing: Adapts dynamically for speed and accuracy.
